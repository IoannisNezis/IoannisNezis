Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm so glad you're here.

Here, you'll find all sorts of projects that I've been working on, ranging from the useful to the completely absurd. But let's be real, you're here for the absurdity.

In my spare time, I like to code random things and see what happens. Sometimes it's a beautiful mess and sometimes it's a beautiful disaster. Either way, it's always a good time.

So take a look around, have a laugh, and if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to fork one of my projects and see what kind of trouble you can get into.

Just don't blame me when your computer catches on fire.

Cheers!
